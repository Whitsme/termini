# Termini
## SSH network device GUI and terminal emulator.

The goal of Termini is be a network device front end GUI, presented as a web page via Flask.
This goal will be accomplished by automatically gathering network device information, displaying relevant documentation for reference, formatting the output of common commands (such as 'show lldp neighbors') to be saved to the network device's configuration, display device port information as if you were looking at a network switch (displays all ports front and back with port numbers colored to match untagged vlan, etc), dropdowns per port showing port details, current vlans, and lldp neighbors, etc.

**Termini is under development. New features will be pushed to this repository as they are developed.**
