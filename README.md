# Termini
## SSH terminal emulator in your browser with network automation features.

The goal of Termini is to make network tasks more approachable to the jr network admin and life a little easier for network admins/engineers/etc.
This goal will be accomplished by automatically gathering network device information, displaying relevant documentation for reference, formatting the output of common commands (such as 'show lldp neighbors') to be saved to the network device's configuration, and whatever else comes to mind along the way.

**Termini is under development. New features will be pushed to this repository as they are developed.**
